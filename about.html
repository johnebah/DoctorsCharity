            <h2>Building a Legacy of Service</h2>
            <div class="about-content">
                <p>
                    Our ultimate aim is to build a legacy of service, 
                    We envision a day when medical professionals the world over will 
                    set a day aside out of their busy schedule every month to volunteer 
                    their time to providing free and qualitative healthcare in poor communities. 
                    We are about service, service to the people and service to the community. 
                </p> 
                <p>
                    We desire a world in which medical professionals and other healthcare providers 
                    would make service to their people, their communities and neighboring 
                    communities an integral part of their monthly schedule.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe that by coming together, 
                    we can build for the world a big global community of 
                    medical care where we are all responsible to the wellbeing 
                    and care of each other and a world where no one goes bankrupt 
                    as a result of falling ill or dies from lack of care due to poverty.
